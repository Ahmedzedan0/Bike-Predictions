# Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon

We make our data in DataFrame format using Pandas, then splitting our data to train and test 
We tried to solve the problem with three different methods
    1.	Without hyperparameters and new feature
    2.	With new features
    3.	With new features and hyperparameters 
We used cloud based IDE , SageMaker studio built on top of Jupyter-lab with suitable python environment 
we used AutoML which it allows us to try many algorithms and parameters till reach maximum accuracy
